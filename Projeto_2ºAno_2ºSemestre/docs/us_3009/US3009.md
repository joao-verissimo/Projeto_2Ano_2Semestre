## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As User, I want to view the history of updates on a board

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


**From the specifications document:**

> - **FRC07 - View Board History -** A user views a history of updates in a board
> - **NFR13 - Design and Implement Shared Board Synchronization-** This functional
    part of the system has very specific technical requirements, particularly some concerns
    about synchronization problems. In fact, several clients will try to concurrently update
    boards. As such, the solution design and implementation must be based on threads,
    condition variables and mutexes. Specific requirements will be provided in SCOMP.

    


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria
