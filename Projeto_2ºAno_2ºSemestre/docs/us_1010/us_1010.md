### 4.4. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that it is not possible to put an invalid title for the course*

```
@Test
    public void ensureCourseTitleCantBeNullOrEmpty(){
        Assertions.assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new Course("JAVA", null
                , "Java Collections Framework", CourseState.CLOSE, new Teacher("AMS"
                , "21321312", LocalDate.of(1990,12,03), null)));

        Assertions.assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new Course("JAVA"
                , "", "Java Collections Framework"
                , CourseState.CLOSE, new Teacher("AMS", "21321312"
                , LocalDate.of(1990,12,03), null)));
    }
```
**Test2** *Verifies that it is not possible to put an invalid code for the course*
```
    @Test
    public void ensureCourseCodeCantBeNullOrEmpty(){
        Assertions.assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            new Course(null, "Java Collections Framework",
                    "Java Collections Framework", CourseState.CLOSE, new Teacher("AMS",
                    "21321312", LocalDate.of(1990,12,03), null));
        });

        Assertions.assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            new Course("", "Java Collections Framework",
                    "Java Collections Framework", CourseState.CLOSE, new Teacher("AMS",
                    "21321312", LocalDate.of(1990,12,03), null));
        });
    }
```
**Test3** *Verifies that it is not possible to put an invalid description for the course*
```
    @Test
    public void ensureCourseDescriptionCantBeNullOrEmpty(){
        Assertions.assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            new Course("JAVA", "Java Collections Framework",
                    null, CourseState.CLOSE, new Teacher("AMS",
                    "21321312", LocalDate.of(1990,12,03), null));
        });

        Assertions.assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            new Course("JAVA", "Java Collections Framework",
                    "", CourseState.CLOSE, new Teacher("AMS",
                    "21321312", LocalDate.of(1990,12,03), null));
        });
    }
```

## 5. Implementation

## ScheduleClassController.java
```
        authz.ensureAuthenticatedUserHasAnyOf(BaseRoles.TEACHER);
        svc.schedule(title,initialTime,finishTime,dayOfTheWeek);
```
